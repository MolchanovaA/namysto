      "Namysto is a grassroots volunteer run charity supporting Ukraine. Our mission is to use our connections and our own hard work to create better outcomes for Ukrainian families and to help all people that, directly or indirectly, have been affected by the Russian invasion in Ukraine.",
      "Since we formed as a group in March 2022, we arranged humanitarian aid and help Ukrainian people affected by the war, we set up collection points in Cambridge and with the help of our members and the generosity of the people of Cambridge, we sent lorry-loads of humanitarian aid directly into Ukraine. Our members tirelessly raised funds by organising online silent auctions, children’s events, open garden parties, cake and plant sales and more. We helped Ukrainians find hosts in Cambridgeshire and some of our own members host Ukrainian refugees too. We also raised awareness about visa delays in the UK and got a lot of national and international media attention.",
      "Our plans for the near future include helping Ukrainian refugees in Cambridge to settle and to make local connections; we do this in collaboration with Ukrainians and support them to set up their own initiatives. We are an open group and welcome every individual and business who want to join in.",
